# 2D-Overlap-Cone-Extension-For-Unity
With this code you can use method for cone overlap

Use this to find colliders within a cone-shaped volume.

It uses SphereCastAll, which is like a RayCast tube, but then it uses Vector3.Angle to filter out hitpoints according to a cone.

Using it is very similar to using SphereCastAll.

<li>Variables:
 <ul> Transform origin,</ul>
 <ul> float originAngle(z axis), </ul>
 <ul>float maxDistance, </ul>
 <ul>float coneAngle </ul>
 </li>
